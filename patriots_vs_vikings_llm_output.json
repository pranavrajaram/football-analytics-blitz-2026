  "rationale": "Dagger/Slot Cross vs two-high: the outside go pins the deep half while the slot deep over splits the safeties and the TE dig creates a high\u2013low on the MIKE; the hook and swing control the flats to keep the corners honest. It\u2019s 11 personnel and spread, matching Patriots personnel without triggering a heavier defensive adjustment."
