Despite using a less predictable 12 personnel and unique formation, the Viking Buster play failed to stretch the defense effectively. The crossing routes and vertical threats did not adequately manipulate the Cover 2 defense, likely because the safeties and linebackers were able to remain disciplined in their zones. The vertical routes may not have been deep enough to pull the safeties out of position, and the crossing routes could have been too shallow, allowing the linebackers to cover them without being stressed vertically or horizontally. In this scenario, increasing the depth of the vertical routes or incorporating more dynamic crossing patterns could have improved the play's effectiveness. Lesson Learned: Ensure that the routes in the play design sufficiently challenge the coverage scheme, particularly by creating mismatches or stretching the defense both vertically and horizontally to increase yardage potential."

In the Thunderbolt Clearout play from a Trips Right formation, the defense's 2-High Shell Cover 2 coverage likely limited the effectiveness of the routes designed to attack the intermediate zones. The safeties in a Cover 2 are well-positioned to cover the deeper routes, while the linebackers and corners can focus on the intermediate zones, reducing the yardage potential. Additionally, using the 12 personnel package may not have added enough vertical threat to stress the defense, as the extra tight end might have been better used to challenge the seams, forcing the safeties to make tougher decisions. Lesson Learned: Consider incorporating more vertical routes or seam threats in 12 personnel to better challenge the depth of Cover 2, potentially opening up space for intermediate routes."

However, the expected yards were slightly below the target at 4.7, suggesting that while the play design was creative, it may not have fully exploited the defensive formation to stretch the field. This could be due to the routes not effectively manipulating the safeties or failing to create sufficient separation in the 'honey hole' area against the Cover 2 defense.

The low predictability score suggests that the use of a post and comeback combination in a trips formation is uncommon on early downs, making it difficult for the defense to anticipate. Additionally, the vertical clearout by the outside receiver (L1) successfully froze the safeties, allowing the post route (L2) to take advantage of the space created. The combination of routes put the right-side safety in a high-low bind, exploiting the Cover 2 defense. Lesson Learned: Continue to incorporate unconventional route combinations in common formations to maintain unpredictability and maximize yardage potential against standard defensive shells like Cover 2."

    "rationale": "The model evaluated the play's predictability at -0.1056, which is slightly above the target threshold, indicating a moderate level of unpredictability. However, the Expected Yards of 4.2 is notably below the target of 5.0, classifying the play as inefficient. This low expected yardage suggests that the route concept failed to adequately stress the defense. The use of '12' personnel with a Bunch Right formation was intended to create mismatches and exploit the Cover 2's zone weaknesses, specifically targeting the 'honey hole' between the cornerback and safety. However, if the corner route did not effectively pull the deep zone defenders, or if the intermediate routes did not sufficiently occupy the linebackers, the defense could maintain coverage integrity and minimize yardage gained. The vertical threats may not have been deep enough to force safeties out of position, allowing them to assist in covering shorter routes. Lesson Learned: Consider incorporating deeper routes or more aggressive vertical threats to stretch the defense vertically, ensuring safeties are occupied and creating more space underneath for intermediate routes, thereby increasing potential yardage."
