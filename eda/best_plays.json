This is likely due to the use of 12 personnel, which differs from previous tendencies and disguises the vertical stretch concept effectively. However, the Expected Yards were slightly below the target at 4.7, suggesting that while the post route was successful in influencing the safeties, the corner route targeting the 'Honey Hole' might not have been executed at the optimal depth or timing to fully capitalize on the defense's coverage lapse. Lesson Learned: To increase expected yards, ensure the corner route is run with precise depth and timing to exploit the 'Honey Hole' more effectively, possibly adjusting receiver speed or quarterback timing slightly to enhance the play's efficiency."
