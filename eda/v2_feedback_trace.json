Additionally, the use of 12 personnel, while less predictable for a passing play, may not have provided enough speed or dynamic route-running to exploit the zones vacated by the safeties. The lack of a clear intermediate or underneath option might have limited the quarterback's ability to effectively check down and gain yards after the catch.

The Viking Vanisher play, executed with a Trips Right formation, aims to exploit the honey hole in Cover 2 defenses. However, in this scenario, the routes may not be effectively stretching the defense. The Corner route is designed to find the gap between the deep zones, but if the defense's Cover 2 is well-executed, the safeties can close in on the Corner route quickly, limiting its effectiveness. Additionally, the Post and Cross routes, intended as clearouts, may not be drawing defenders away effectively if the defensive backs are disciplined in their zone coverage, leading to crowded passing lanes and limited yards after catch opportunities. The predictability score is slightly negative (-0.0409), indicating acceptable unpredictability, so the formation and play call aren't inherently predictable.

    "rationale": "The play was evaluated with a low predictability score (-0.0539), indicating that the use of the 'Viking Slayer' play with a Trips Left formation successfully reduced predictability against the defense's 2-high shell. The combination of deep and intermediate routes from the Trips Left formation effectively challenged the cover 2 structure, which typically aims to prevent deep passes. However, the expected yards were slightly below the target (4.7 vs. > 5.0), suggesting that while the play was efficient, it didn't fully exploit the defense for maximum yardage. This could be due to some intermediate routes not successfully stretching the defense vertically or horizontally enough to create larger gains. Lesson Learned: Consider incorporating more aggressive vertical routes or adding a quick release option against the 2-high shell to increase the yardage potential while maintaining low predictability."
